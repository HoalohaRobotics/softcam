# Change Log

All notable changes to the Softcam library will be documented in this file.

### [Unreleased]
- Fixed an issue on Debug DLL name confusion.
    - The example program `sender.exe` with `Debug` configuration was failing to run because the import library `softcamd.lib` wrongly tries to find `softcam.dll` (not `softcamd.dll`).
    - Now the import library is fixed to use `softcamd.dll` correctly.


### [1.1] - 2021-01-02
- Added PostBuildEvent which makes the `dist` directory that holds the header and the binaries.
- Changed the build configuration of examples to use the `dist` directory and made them independent of the library's build.
- Improved timing calculation.
- Added a figure on top of the README.


### [1.0] - 2020-12-16
- Initial release
